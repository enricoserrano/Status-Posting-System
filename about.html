         <p><b>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website?</b></p>
         <p><li>I have made sure to include error messages for bad inputs and made sure the validation would cover all the bad input, eg. you can restrict the user from pressing space for the first character, but you can highlight the text field and press space, and it would allow you to submit it.</li></p>
         <p><li>Another issue I fixed would be with the search status form since its a 'GET' method, you can modify the url at the top and leave the variable empty, which results in fetching all the database. As a solution I have added an error message.</li></p>
         <p><li>I have also made sure that the user can't input an invalid date eg. Not allowing month of February to have more than 28 days (also works for leap years)</li></p>
         <p><li>I have also made sure if no permission is set, show 'No Permission Selected' in the search status page</li></p>
         <p><b>Which part(s) did you have trouble with?</b></p>
         <p><li>I had a trouble with input validation as sometimes, I would find ways to break the validation which leads me to implement a fix and tests for more inputs.</li></p>
         <p><li>Additionally, I had trouble with searching for status within the database as sometimes it would just return all results instead of filter it out.</li></p>
         <p><li>Another issue I found was the browser is not updating the changes I have made, I fixed this by pressing CTRL-F5 instead of refresh since it clears caches.</li></p>
         <p><b>What would you like to do better next time?</b></p>
         <p><li>I would improve with the design consistency and a feature to delete status records(admin).</li></p>
         <p><b>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this project? If so, please include the sources.</b></p>
         <p><li>The main thing I learned from this assignment is being able to create database, communicate, and fetch data from database. I believe this would help me in the future as I start to create more programs.</li></p>
